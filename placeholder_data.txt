The R.I.C.E. method is a common first-aid treatment for acute soft tissue injuries, like sprains and strains. R.I.C.E. stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation.

Rest is crucial after an injury to allow the body to heal. Avoid activities that cause pain or stress to the injured area for the first 24-48 hours.

Applying ice to an injury helps reduce pain and swelling. Use an ice pack wrapped in a towel for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Do not apply ice directly to the skin.

Compression, such as with an elastic bandage, helps to limit swelling and provide support to the injured joint or limb. Ensure the bandage is snug but not so tight that it cuts off circulation.

Elevation involves raising the injured part above the level of your heart. This helps to reduce swelling by allowing fluid to drain away from the area. For an ankle or knee injury, you can prop your leg up on pillows while lying down.

Proper posture is essential for preventing and managing lower back pain. When sitting, keep your back straight, shoulders back, and feet flat on the floor. Avoid slouching.

Core strengthening exercises are key to supporting the lower back. Exercises like planks, bird-dog, and bridges help build stability in the muscles around your spine.

Stretching tight hamstring muscles can also alleviate lower back pain. A simple seated hamstring stretch involves sitting on the floor with one leg extended, and gently leaning forward until you feel a stretch in the back of your thigh. Hold for 30 seconds.
